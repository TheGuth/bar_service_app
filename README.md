#Bar Service App (Name in progress)

##To Reach MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

###Overall Ideas

1. Have a Client and Business Interface
2. Use MongoDb for database to Start, possibly switch to posgtres later on for scaling.
3. Build out Schemas and models in Mongo
  1. Client User
  2. Business User
  3. drinks, to food, to coffee,  
  4. build your own schema (build an appetizer)

###Client Side Ideas

1. Client has a profile, with picture of driver license/ or driver license number, profile picture, settings, credit Card information, etc...

2. Client can see a list of nearby business that use the app.

3. Client can directly enter business code to sync up to the business of their choice or select from the list of nearby places.

4. Client can order service from the specific business, in this case an alcoholic beverage, when a client makes a purchase it submits their driver license picture and card info to the business, the client then receives an estimated time for when the drink will be ready and where they are in the queue. This return message can also be changed to add where to pick up the drink, unless the business wants to deliver the drink as well.

5. Clients can create a favorite list of drink types.

6. Client when connect to a business will be taken to their business page,

  1. which will have a scroll through list of possible drinks to be able to select, and ordered, multiple selections will be available, so you can order more than one drink?

  2. Will have busy level

  3. current wait time for a drink

  4. address linked to google maps.

  5. phone-number

###Business Side Ideas

1. Business profile includes pictures, name, address, phone-number, current-level of how busy, or wait time for drinks/seats, access to creating new drinks/basic crud operations, payment gateway

MVP (don't have to handle payments) no revenue generated
free to use app.
eventually add in percentage taken.

basic client website:
1. user sign up and authentication
2. profile creation through form.
3. Use libraries for optimization (http://redux-form.com/6.5.0/examples/)
4. notification system (https://github.com/igorprado/react-notification-system)
5. react-bootstrap and flex box (https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
6.

time estimates
1. click button to say drink is done: sends message/receipt back to buyer / 1:00
2.
3.
4.

walk up during this time, and that not calculated

Node and Express
1. End Points
2. micro Services (authentication, basic-authentication, emailer, )
3. Mongoose connection and searching through mongo
4. Testing

MongoDb
