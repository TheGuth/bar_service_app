# Q-less (web)

Collaborators: James Guthrie & Laura Wolfart

## Background

We built this app drawing from a common problem that we have seen when going out to popular bars and clubs. This problem is that it is very hard to fight through the crows to order your drink in a timely manner.

### This app has two main components:

* 1. allow users to see the bar or clubs drink menu from their phone and place an order.
* 2. allow bars and clubs to have a platform to receive orders from their customers via the app, and be able to customize their menu.

## Use Case

Why is this app useful? If your like me then you hate having to wait for the opportunity to place an order, while you could be out dancing or talking with your friends, this app will allow you the ability to place orders without skipping a beat, that way you can enjoy your night with minimal down time. Business will have to decide on their own whether they will have a pick up area for ordered drinks or actually bring them to the customer.

* A landing page with a connect interface for customers to connect to their favorite bar or club to place and order.

* A business dashboard where the business can receive orders as well as create and edit their menu.
* A customer dashboard where they can see the current menu of the bar or club they are at and select drinks to add to an order, which they can then submit to the business.
